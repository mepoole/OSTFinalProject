OSTFinalProject
===============

Final project for Open Source Tools Fall 2014.
This application is a sort of "quora" or message board where users can ask questions and post responses, vote on these questions or responses, and favorite certain questions.

The project was written in Python, using Google AppEngine and Google's Datastore. The front-end was created using Django templates.
